Learn how to build BART, BERT and GPT models from scrath using Python and Pytorch.

The code in this repository is meant as reference for those who want to learn how to do entry level programing of large language models.

There are many todo's that I still need to complete for this repository, but in the mean time please feel free to refernece and use the code in your projects as you see fit.

I will provide a Google Drive link to all of the pre-trained and fine-tuned models once I am able to upload them.

I am currently working on building mini-packages for vision and audio models and will commit those once they are complete.

More to follow...enjoy and happy coding!
